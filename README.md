# Whatsapp Clone Client

[//]: # (head-end)



A full working React client for a WhatsApp clone written in latest versions of:

* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
* [Material-UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui)
* [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6)

This project was made after trying to replicate the work of [Youtube Tuturial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxrDcITyjg)
As I was trying to implement according to the video I came across alot of command miscompatibility due to firebase recent upgrade MIU upgrade and react-router-dom upgrade.

After figuring out how to solve the compatibility issues I thought it would be a great practice for people trying to implement it themselves.


## Running locally

Clone the project.

Open a new server using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), Assign the firebase configuration correctly according to FB site.

Install dependencies:

`npm install`

Start the client:

`npm start`
